-- Temporarily disable RLS on portfolio_images for testing
-- This is a quick fix to resolve the immediate issue
-- In production, you should use proper RLS policies

-- Drop all existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view portfolio images" ON public.portfolio_images;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can manage portfolio images for their items" ON public.portfolio_images;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public can view portfolio images for public profiles" ON public.portfolio_images;

-- Temporarily disable RLS
ALTER TABLE public.portfolio_images DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Note: In production, you should re-enable RLS with proper policies
-- ALTER TABLE public.portfolio_images ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
